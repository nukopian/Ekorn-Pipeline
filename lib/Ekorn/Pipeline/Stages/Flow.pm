=head1 NAME

Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Flow - stages taking or dropping values: take, drop, take_while and drop_while

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ekorn::Pipeline;
    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Flow;    # take and drop

    # The third page of ten
    my @page = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(drop(20), take(10))->(@names);

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Flow qw(:DEFAULT take_while drop_while);

    # A mail's headers: its lines up to the first blank one
    my $headers = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(take_while { m( \S )x })
        ->iterator(sub { scalar(<$fh>) // () });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stages that decide which values go on, by their position or by a
test, whatever the values are. Each function returns a stage. It
checks its arguments when it's called, not on each value.

Each stage is an object, an L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stage> or, for those
that keep state, an L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather>, called as a code
reference, so it goes wherever a stage goes. Code testing it with
C<ref> or C<is_coderef> sees an object: v0.2.0 gave code references.

C<take>, C<drop>, C<take_last>, C<take_single> and C<drop_while> keep
state, so they're made with
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather> and start afresh on each run. A run is a
call of a pipeline with values, or an iterator made from it.

C<take>, C<take_first>, C<take_single> and C<take_while> end the
pipeline with
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stop> once they've passed on all they will, so an
iterator stops calling its source.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

C<take> and C<drop> are exported by default. C<take_first>,
C<take_last>, C<take_single>, C<take_while> and C<drop_while> are
exported on request, and C<:all> gives all seven. To get the defaults
and one more, name C<:DEFAULT> too:

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Flow qw(:DEFAULT take_while);

=head2 take

    take($count)

Passes on the first C<$count> values, then stops the pipeline. If there
are fewer, it passes them all on. C<take(0)> passes on none, but it
still sees the first value, because a stage isn't called until there
is one.

=head2 drop

    drop($count)

Drops the first C<$count> values, and passes on the rest. With
C<take>, it gives a page:

    drop(20), take(10)    # the 21st to the 30th

=head2 take_first

    take_first

Passes on the first value, then stops the pipeline: C<take(1)>, named
as the stage of the sink C<keep_first>.

=head2 take_last

    take_last

Passes on the last value, once there are no more, reading every one to
find it; nothing if there were none. If a stage before it stops the
pipeline, it passes on the last value to reach it.

Each C<take_...> stage passes on what the C<keep_...> sink of the same
name, in L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sinks>, gives as its result, so the stages
after it can go on: C<take($n)> is C<keep($n)>'s, and C<take_first>,
C<take_last> and C<take_single> are C<keep_first>'s, C<keep_last>'s
and C<keep_single>'s. C<keep_all> has none, as its stage would pass
every value on, and be no stage at all. A pipeline ending in a C<take>
stage, where its sink was forgotten, gives the values in list context,
and how many in scalar context, never a wrong one.

=head2 take_single

    take_single

Passes on the one value. At a second, it warns "Expected only one item,
but there were more" and stops the pipeline, so the first is all that
goes on: for when one value was meant, and its limit forgotten.

=head2 take_while

    take_while { ... }

Passes on values while the block returns true for them, then stops the
pipeline at the first value it returns false for. That value isn't
passed on. The block gets each value in C<$_> and as its argument.

=head2 drop_while

    drop_while { ... }

Drops values while the block returns true for them, then passes on the
rest, starting with the first value it returns false for. After that,
the block isn't called again on that run. The block gets each value in
C<$_> and as its argument.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Expected a count of 0 or more

C<take> or C<drop> was given something other than a whole number.

=item Expected a code reference

C<take_while> or C<drop_while> was given something other than a block
or code reference.

=item Expected only one item, but there were more

A warning: C<take_single> was given a second value, and stopped the
pipeline, passing on only the first.
