=head1 NAME

Ekorn::Pipeline::Sinks - ready-made sinks, needing only Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Sinks qw(:all);

    my @all   = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(keep_all)->(@values);          # every value
    my $all   = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(keep_all)->(@values);          # the same, as an array reference
    my $n     = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(count_items)->(@values);       # how many
    my $first = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(keep_first)->iterator($source)->();    # stops at the first

    my $copied = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(to_file('copy.txt'))->iterator(from_file('original.txt'))->();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sinks, each usually given last in a pipeline, so that its result is
what a run gives (see L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sink>). Each is made afresh
for each run. Nothing is exported by default; ask for each, or for
C<:all>.

They come in two families. Those named for what they give, an item
being a value, have names that can't clash with Perl's built-ins or
List::Util's, which is why they're C<keep_first> and C<keep_all>, not
C<first> and C<all>. The containers, named for where the items go, are
the C<to_> sinks, each the counterpart of a C<from_> source in
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sources>: what one reads, the other writes.

Asked for one value, in scalar context, a sink giving a list gives it
as an array reference. An array reference is true even when it's
empty, so test for no items with C<@$all>, or use C<count_items>.

A sink that stops the pull early is told C<done>: it decided the run
had enough. The source and the stages before it are told C<stopped>.

Each sink taking no arguments has an empty prototype, so that
C<count_items + 0> reads as C<count_items() + 0>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 keep_all

Gives every item, as a list. It's a sink of many.

=head2 keep

    keep($n)

Gives the first C<$n> items, as a list, as C<take($n)> would pass on,
and stops the run once it has them. It's a sink of many. It croaks
"Expected a count of 0 or more", as C<take> does, given anything but a
whole number.

=head2 keep_first

Gives the first item, or C<undef> if there was none, and stops the run
there.

=head2 keep_single

Gives the one item, or C<undef> if there was none. At a second, it
warns "Expected only one item, but there were more", and stops the
run, giving the first: for when you meant one item, and forgot to limit
it to one.

=head2 keep_last

Gives the last item, reading every one to find it, or C<undef> if there
was none.

=head2 count_items

Gives how many items there were.

=head2 to_fh

    to_fh($fh)

Prints each item to C<$fh>, a filehandle you opened, followed by C<$/>,
and gives how many. It leaves the filehandle open, for you to close. It
croaks "Expected an open filehandle" given anything else.

=head2 to_file

    to_file($path)
    to_file($path, $layers)

Writes each item to the file at C<$path>, followed by C<$/>, and gives
how many. The file is opened, emptied, as the run starts, through the
I/O layers given, if any, such as C<':raw'> or C<':encoding(UTF-8)'>,
and closed once the run has ended, however it ended.

C<from_fh> and C<from_file> take C<$/> off each record, and C<to_fh> and
C<to_file> add it back, so a file read with one is written unchanged by
the other. With C<$/> undefined, or a reference to a record size,
nothing is added; with it empty, for paragraphs, a blank line is.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Expected a count of 0 or more

L</keep> was given something other than a whole number.

=item Expected only one item, but there were more

A warning: L</keep_single> was given a second item, and stopped the
run, giving the first.

=item Expected an open filehandle

L</to_fh> was given something other than an open filehandle.

=item Can't write %s: %s

L</to_fh> or L</to_file> couldn't write, or L</to_file> couldn't open
or close its file; the second part says why. The first is the file's
path, or "the filehandle".
