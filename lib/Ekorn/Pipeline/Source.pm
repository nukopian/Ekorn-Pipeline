=head1 NAME

Ekorn::Pipeline::Source - a source made afresh for each run

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Source;

    sub lines_of ($path) {
        return Ekorn::Pipeline::Source->new(sub {
            open my $fh, '<', $path or die "Can't read $path: $!\n";    # this run's
            return (
                sub ()     { my $line = readline $fh; defined $line ? $line : () },
                sub ($how) { close $fh },
            );
        });
    }

    my $next = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(take(2))->iterator(lines_of('names.txt'));
    # reads two lines, then closes the file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A source gives the values a run starts with, one pull at a time. Any
code reference is one: called with nothing, it returns the next value
or values, and an empty list once there are no more. But a code
reference is the same closure in every run, and is never told when the
run has ended, so it can't close what it opened.

A source made with this class is made afresh for each run, by its
I<set-up>, a code reference called at the start of the run. The set-up
declares, with C<my>, whatever the run needs, such as a filehandle, and
returns closures sharing it:

=over

=item * the I<step>, called with nothing each time the run wants more
values, returning the next value or values, or an empty list at the
end. It's required;

=item * optionally, the I<end>, called once, when the run has ended,
however it ended, told how, as its argument: C<done> if the source was
read to its end, C<stopped> if the run was cut short before it was,
and C<died> if the run died. What it returns is dropped;

=item * optionally, a I<context>: anything the run's stages may ask
for with L<Ekorn::Pipeline/run_context>, such as a statement's
columns.

=back

So two iterators of the same pipeline, reading the same source, each
get their own filehandle, and each closes its own, when its run ends.
L<Ekorn::Pipeline/How a run ends> says when that is, and what each
part is told.

The step can stop the run with L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stop>, when it has
had enough. The values the stop carries are its last, and it's told
C<done>.

A source goes where a source goes: given to
L<Ekorn::Pipeline/iterator>. It isn't a stage, and given to
L<Ekorn::Pipeline/new> as one, it croaks. Called directly, as a code
reference, it croaks too: a run of its own would never be ended, so
what it opened would stay open.

The word C<source {...}>, in L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Factories>, makes one
of these from a block.

A class of your own needn't be one of these to be a source. Any
object with an C<ekorn_source> method, returning the step and
optionally the end and the context, is one.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $source = Ekorn::Pipeline::Source->new($setup);

Returns a source made afresh for each run by C<$setup>, a code
reference, as L</DESCRIPTION> describes. Anything else croaks.

=head2 ekorn_source

    my($step, $end, $context) = $source->ekorn_source;

Calls the set-up, for a new run, and returns what it returns. A run
calls it as it starts; you needn't.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Expected a code reference

L</new> was given something other than a code reference.

=item Expected a source to be read through iterator

A source was called as a code reference. Give it to
L<Ekorn::Pipeline/iterator> instead.

=item Expected the source to return a code reference, and optionally an end and a context

The set-up returned something else: no step, or a step or end that
isn't a code reference. It's reported as the run starts.
