=head1 NAME

Ekorn::Pipeline::Tooling - Ekorn's stages, sources, sinks and words, from one module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ekorn::Pipeline;
    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Tooling qw(:all);

    my $first = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(
        take_if { m( \A ERROR )x },
        keep_first,
    )->iterator(from_file('app.log'))->();

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Tooling qw(:stages :sinks);    # or only some
    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Tooling qw(take keep_all);     # or by name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

What a caller uses to do work with Ekorn::Pipeline is made in several
modules: stages in Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Flow, Batch and Taps,
sources in Ekorn::Pipeline::Sources, sinks in Ekorn::Pipeline::Sinks,
JSON's source, sink and stages in Ekorn::Pipeline::JSON, the words in
Ekorn::Pipeline::Factories, and C<Stop> and C<gather> in
modules of their own. This module exports all of them, by the tags
below, so there's one module to import from, and nothing to remember
about which module makes which.

Each name is the very sub its own module exports, prototype and all,
so C<take_if { ... }> and C<stage { ... }> parse as they do imported
from there. Importing a name from both does no harm.

Nothing is exported by default: ask for tags, or names, or both. An
unknown tag or name is reported by Exporter, as it is for any module.

It leaves out what's for extending the package rather than using it,
such as C<is_stage> and C<is_sink>, from L<Ekorn::Pipeline>, and
C<croakf>, from L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Errors>: import those from their
own modules. And it doesn't put the operators in force:
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Operators> is a pragma, which puts C<|> in force
only in the scope that uses it, by name.

=head1 TAGS

=over

=item C<:core>

C<Stop>, from L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stop>, and C<gather>, from
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather>.

=item C<:flow>

Everything L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Flow> exports: C<take>,
C<take_first>, C<take_last>, C<take_single>, C<take_if>,
C<take_while>, C<drop>, C<drop_if> and C<drop_while>.

=item C<:batch>

Everything L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Batch> exports: C<batch> and
C<collect>.

=item C<:taps>

Everything L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Taps> exports: C<peek>,
C<count_into> and C<dump_to>.

=item C<:stages>

C<:flow>, C<:batch> and C<:taps>.

=item C<:sources>

Everything L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sources> exports: C<from_array>,
C<from_fh>, C<from_file> and C<counter>.

=item C<:sinks>

Everything L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sinks> exports: C<count_items>,
C<keep>, C<keep_all>, C<keep_first>, C<keep_last>, C<keep_single>,
C<to_fh> and C<to_file>.

=item C<:json>

Everything L<Ekorn::Pipeline::JSON> exports: C<from_json> and
C<to_json>. L<JSON> exports names of its own the same, by default, so
a module using both imports C<:all> from only one of them.

=item C<:words>

Everything L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Factories> exports: C<pipeline>,
C<stage>, C<gather>, C<source>, C<generator> and C<yield>,
C<sink_one> and C<sink_many>.

=item C<:all>

All of the above.

=back

A tag holds every name its module exports, by default or on request.
What a tag holds is part of the interface: a name may be added to one
in a release that only adds, but is dropped or renamed only in one that
moves the middle number of the version.
