=head1 NAME

Ekorn::Pipeline::Sugar - name pipelines as the program compiles, each with a function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Sugar pipeline => {
        titles => [sub { $_->{title} }],
        top    => ['titles', take(3)],
    };

    my @titles = titles(@tracks);    # values in, a list out
    my @top    = top(@tracks);       # the first three titles
    my @loud   = top(@tracks, pipeline(sub { uc }));    # and more stages

    my $next = pipeline('top')->iterator($source);    # pulled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A pipeline used in several places can be named once, as the program
compiles, rather than kept in a variable or wrapped in a sub. C<use
Ekorn::Pipeline::Sugar> takes C<pipeline> and the definitions after
it, each a name and an array of stages. Each pipeline is named in the
package that uses the module, as L<Ekorn::Pipeline/named> names it, so
C<pipeline('name')> finds it, and the package gets a function of each
name.

The definitions are a hash, C<{...}>, or an array of pairs, C<[...]>,
to read in order. A string where a stage goes names a pipeline, as it
does in C<pipeline> and C<named>: one from the same C<use>, or one
defined before it. A definition can name any other in the same C<use>,
in either order: each is defined once those it names are.

Nothing is exported: C<use> defines the names it's given, and nothing
else. A mistake croaks as the C<use> is compiled, at its line.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 A function of each name

    my @results = name(@values);
    my @results = name(@values, $pipeline);

Runs the values through the pipeline of that name, and returns what
comes out, in the caller's context, as calling the pipeline does: a
list in list context; in scalar context, a sink's result, or how many
values came out. Given a pipeline last, such as one made with the word
C<pipeline>, it runs them through that too, after the named one, so a
caller can add stages of their own. A pipeline is taken for stages
only last, so any other value, a code reference included, is a value.

To pull values through it from a source, use the pipeline itself:
C<< pipeline('name')->iterator($source) >>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 import_into

    Ekorn::Pipeline::Sugar->import_into($package, pipeline => {...});

Does what C<use> does, for C<$package> in place of its caller: for a
module whose own sugar takes pipelines, and hands them on, so they're
named in, and given to, the package that uses that module. The names
are read in C<$package>, as is a string naming a pipeline.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Expected pipeline, not %s

C<use> was given something other than C<pipeline> and its
definitions.

=item Expected the pipelines after pipeline in a HASH or an ARRAY of pairs

C<pipeline> was followed by something else.

=item Expected the pipelines after pipeline in pairs of a name and an ARRAY

An array of definitions had an odd number of items.

=item Expected a name for a pipeline (%s)

A name can't be a function's: it's a word, of letters, digits and
underscores, not starting with a digit.

=item Expected a pipeline defined once (%s)

An array of definitions gave the name twice.

=item Expected the pipeline %s in an ARRAY

A definition wasn't an array reference of stages.

=item Expected no function of the name in %s already (%s)

The package has a function of that name already, its own or one it
inherits.

=item Expected pipelines that don't name each other in a circle (%s)

The definitions named, those left undefined, name each other, through
others or not, so none can be defined first.

=back

L<Ekorn::Pipeline>'s messages for stages and names are raised for a
definition as for C<pipeline>, such as "No pipeline named %s", for a
name defined nowhere, and "A pipeline named %s is already defined".

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Ekorn::Pipeline>, whose C<named> names a pipeline as the program
runs; L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Factories>, whose C<pipeline> fetches one by
its name; and L<DBIx::Squirrel::Sugar>, which names databases and
statements the same way.
