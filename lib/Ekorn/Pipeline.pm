=head1 DESCRIPTION

A pipeline is a list of stages. A stage is a code reference; another
pipeline, which stands for its own stages (see
L</A pipeline as a stage>); a stage made for each run, with
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather>; or a sink, which consumes the values and
gives a result (see L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sink>).

A code reference is called with one value, both as its argument and
in C<$_>. It can name the value with a signature,
C<sub ($row) { $row-E<gt>[1] }>, or use C<$_>, C<sub { $_-E<gt>[1] }>.
C<$_> is localised for each call, so the caller's is left alone. It
returns a list:

=over

=item * nothing, to drop the value (a filter);

=item * one value, to pass it on (a map);

=item * several, each of which goes through the rest of the stages
on its own (a flatMap).

=back

Each value goes through every stage before the next one starts. The
values come out in order, and each stage sees them in the order a
C<for> loop would.

A stage can end the pipeline early with L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stop>. The
values already out are kept, and any values the stop carries go on
through the rest of the stages. Nothing else is processed:

    sub ($row) { $row->{id} == $wanted ? Stop($row) : () }

Each call of a pipeline with values is a run, and so is each
iterator. A stage made with L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather> is made afresh
for each run, and so are a source and a sink, so a run can open a file,
or start a transaction, and close or commit it when it ends, however
it ends: see L</RUNS AND HOW THEY END>.

=head2 Stages from your caller

A pipeline is for the author of any function that hands out values.
The function takes stages from its caller, as its last arguments, and
runs what it would return through them. The caller says what they want
done with each value, beside the call, and gets back only what they
want:

    sub bands (@stages) {
        return Ekorn::Pipeline->new(@stages)->(load_bands());
    }

    my @names = bands(sub { $_->{name} }, take(5));

With L</iterator>, the values are made one at a time, as the caller
asks for them. A function reading a file or a socket reads no more
than it has to. Once a stage has stopped the pipeline, the source isn't
called again.

Values can come from a source, given to L</iterator>: a code
reference, or one made with L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Source>, which is told
when the run ends. And a pipeline can end in a sink, such as
C<keep_all> or C<count_items>, from L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sinks>, whose
result is what the run gives.

The canned stages, in L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Flow>,
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Batch> and L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stages::Taps>,
work in any pipeline. L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Pipes> gives a class of your
own C<pipe> and C<tap> methods, which run an object through stages.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $p = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(@stages);

Returns a pipeline that runs values through C<@stages>, in order. Each
stage must be something L</is_stage> is true for: a code reference; a
pipeline (see L</A pipeline as a stage>); or a part offering one of the
role methods C<EKORN_STAGE>, C<EKORN_SINK_ONE> and C<EKORN_SINK_MANY>,
such as a gather or a sink. Anything else croaks, a source included.
With no stages, a pipeline returns its values unchanged.

A pipeline is an object that can be called as a code reference. Called
with values, it returns the list that comes out of the last stage:

    my @results = $p->(@values);

In scalar context, it returns how many results came out, as an array
would:

    my $count = $p->(@values);

Unless its last stage is a sink: then a run gives the sink's result. In
list context, that's the sink's list, or a sink of one's one value. In
scalar context, a sink of one gives its value, and a sink of many its
list as an array reference:

    my $n    = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(count_items)->('a', 'b');    # 2
    my $kept = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(keep_all)->('a', 'b');       # ['a', 'b']

=head3 A pipeline as a stage

You can give C<new> a pipeline wherever it takes a stage. Its stages
are spliced in where it stands, so these two run the same:

    my $clean = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(sub { s( \A \s+ | \s+ \z )()xgr }, sub { length ? $_ : () });

    Ekorn::Pipeline->new($clean, take(10));
    Ekorn::Pipeline->new($clean->stages, take(10));

The spliced stages belong to the new pipeline's run. A C<take> inside
C<$clean> limits the whole run, not each value.

The only difference is in error messages. Given C<$clean> itself, a
stage inside it is named by its position in each pipeline: the third
stage of a pipeline given second is C<#2.3>, and three levels down,
C<#1.2.3>. Given C<< $clean->stages >>, it's named by its position in
the combined list.

The stages spliced in are whatever the pipeline's L</stages> method
returns, so a subclass can override it. If the override returns a
different list, its stages are named by their position in that list.

To run a pipeline on each value separately instead, call it from a
stage: C<sub { $clean-E<gt>($_) }>. Each call is then a run of its
own, and a C<take> inside limits each call.

=head2 named

    Ekorn::Pipeline->named(clean => @stages);         # define from stages
    Ekorn::Pipeline->new(@stages)->named('clean');    # name one you have

Names a pipeline, and returns it. On the class, it makes a pipeline of
the stages after the name, each a code reference, a pipeline or the
name of one, as L</pipeline_in> takes them, looked up in its caller's
package; a subclass makes one of its own class. On a pipeline, it
names that one, and croaks if given stages after the name.

The name is kept in the caller's package, unless it's qualified, as
L</Named pipelines> explains. A name is identifiers, as Perl's, joined
by C<::>, such as C<clean> or C<My::Module::clean>. It's new in v0.3.0.

A name can't be defined twice for another pipeline, which croaks,
whatever class C<named> was called on. Naming the same pipeline again,
with C<< $p->named('clean') >>, is no mistake; but C<named> on a class
always makes a new pipeline, even from a single pipeline, so calling
C<< Ekorn::Pipeline->named(clean => $p) >> twice croaks. A name can't
be removed, so define each once, as a program or module loads.

=head3 Named pipelines

A named pipeline is kept for the life of the program, in a package,
which says whose name it is, so two modules can each have a
C<clean>.

=over

=item * C<named> keeps a name in the package that called it, and
the word C<pipeline> and C<named> look one up in the package that
called them,
so two modules can each have a C<clean> of their own.

=item * A qualified name, such as C<My::Module::clean>, is that
package's, wherever it's used. Code that names or looks up pipelines on
another package's behalf qualifies them: C<"${package}::clean">.

=item * A name is resolved when the pipeline is made, not when it runs,
and the pipeline it names is spliced in, as a pipeline given to L</new>
is. So a pipeline, once made, keeps the pipelines it found, whatever's
defined or overridden later.

=item * Only L</pipeline_in>, which the word C<pipeline> calls, and
C<named> read names. L</new> doesn't, and L</is_stage> is false for a
string.

=back

=head2 name

    my $name = $p->name;

Returns the first name the pipeline was given with L</named>,
qualified by its package, as C<main::clean>, or C<undef> if it has
none. Errors in its stages name it (see L</DIAGNOSTICS>). It's new in
v0.3.0.

=head2 pipeline_in

    Ekorn::Pipeline->pipeline_in($package, @stages)

Returns a new pipeline of its invocant's class, of C<@stages>, each a
code reference, a pipeline, or the name of one, looked up in
C<$package> unless it's qualified, as L</Named pipelines> explains. It's
the only method that reads names, and it's what the word C<pipeline>,
from L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Factories>, calls, with its caller's package:

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Factories qw(pipeline);

    pipeline(sub { uc }, take(5))                # new, from stages
    pipeline('clean')                            # the pipeline named clean

Call it from code the user calls directly, passing the user's package,
as the word does with C<scalar caller>. Code that passes stages
through, such as a function taking stages from its caller, gives them
to L</new>, which reads no names: the user has already turned any
names into pipelines with C<pipeline>, where they wrote them. If C<new>
read names, it would look them up in the package of whatever called
it, which, for a function passing its caller's stages on, isn't the
caller's.

A function whose values can be code references can't tell them from
stages with L</is_stage>, but it can take a pipeline given last as its
stages, which a caller makes with C<pipeline>:

    sub call_all (@callbacks) {
        my $stages = @callbacks && $callbacks[-1] isa 'Ekorn::Pipeline' ? pop @callbacks : pipeline();
        return $stages->(map { $_->() } @callbacks);
    }

    call_all(@callbacks, pipeline(sub { $_ * 10 }, take(2)));

It's new in v0.3.0, as is the word C<pipeline>.

=head2 iterator

    my $next = $p->iterator($source);

Returns an iterator, an L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Iterator>, which hands out
the values that come out of the stages, one per call. C<$source> is a
code reference that returns the next value or values each time it's
called, and an empty list when there are no more; or anything offering
an C<EKORN_SOURCE> method, such as an L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Source>, made
for the run and told when it ends, or another iterator. It's called
only once the values from its last call have all been handed out.

The closure returns an empty list when the values run out, and on
every call after that. After a stop, it returns an empty list once the
values the stop carried are handed out, and the source isn't called
again. Read the closure in list context, so that an C<undef> value
isn't mistaken for the end:

    while (my($x) = $next->()) { ... }

The flushes of gathers and sinks are called once their input runs
out, before the closure returns an empty list. The run's ends are
called as it ends, as L</RUNS AND HOW THEY END> describes. The
iterator has methods of its own, to pull every value still to come,
or the first, and to end the run early: see
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Iterator>.

If a stage or a flush dies, the call dies with it, and the run has
ended, as a pushed run does. Every call after returns an empty list.
Nothing waiting goes on through the stages, no flush is called, and
the source isn't called again; each end is called, told C<died>, before
the error is thrown again. To skip a bad value and carry on, catch the
error inside the stage.

=head2 stages

    my @stages = $p->stages;

Returns the pipeline's stages, in order. A pipeline that was given as
a stage appears as the stages it was made of. In scalar context, it
returns how many there are.

The list can go anywhere stages go: to L</new>, or to a function that
takes stages. Each is one of Ekorn's types, an object called as a code
reference: a code reference given to C<new> comes back as an
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stage> of it. So a function that takes only plain
code references, testing them with C<is_coderef> or C<ref>, won't take
them; v0.2.0 gave the code references themselves.

    my $clean  = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(sub { s( \A \s+ | \s+ \z )()xgr }, sub { length ? $_ : () });
    my @titles = Ekorn::Pipeline->new($clean->stages, take(10))->(@raw);

To give C<new> the pipeline itself, see L</A pipeline as a stage>.
Either way, the stages run as if they had been written out in full:

=over

=item * A stop in one of them ends the whole run.

=item * A stage made with L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather> starts afresh on
each run, so pipelines that share it don't share its state.

=item * A plain closure is the same code reference wherever it goes,
so anything it keeps is shared. Keep state in C<gather> instead.

=item * A stage that dies is named by its position, as
L</A pipeline as a stage> describes.

=back

=head1 RUNS AND HOW THEY END

A run is one call of a pipeline with values, or one iterator made from
it. Each run has its own state. A part of the pipeline that needs
state, such as a batch it's filling or a file it has open, is made
afresh for each run.

=head2 Made for a run

A gather (L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather>), a source
(L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Source>) or a sink (L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sink>) has a
I<set-up>, a code reference called at the start of each run. It
declares whatever the run needs, with C<my>, and returns closures
sharing what it declared:

=over

=item * the I<step>, called with each value (a gather or a sink), or
each time the source is pulled (a source);

=item * the I<flush>, for a gather or a sink, called once its input
runs out, what it returns going on through the stages after it. A
sink's gives its result, and is required;

=item * the I<end>, called once, when the run has ended, told how. It's
optional;

=item * a I<context>, for a source only, and optional: anything its
stages may ask for with L</run_context>.

=back

Two iterators of the same pipeline each get their own, from their own
call of the set-up. A plain code reference is never made for a run:
it's the same code, with the same closure, in every run.

The set-up returns its parts as a list, in the order above, leaving
out those it doesn't give from the end, and giving C<undef> for one it
leaves out before one it gives. Or it returns them I<by name>, as a
hash reference whose keys are C<step>, C<flush>, C<end> and
C<context>, giving only those it has, in any order:

    gather {
        my $n = 0;    # this run's
        return {
            step => sub ($x)   { $n++; $x },
            end  => sub ($how) { $$total = $n },
        };
    }

A key Ekorn doesn't read is ignored, and a hash without what its part
needs, a step, and a sink's flush, croaks, as a list without them
does. Only a plain hash reference returned alone is taken for parts by
name. Parts by name are new in v0.3.0.

Any object can take part, by offering a role method that does what a
set-up does, returning the same parts, as a list or by name:
C<EKORN_SOURCE>, C<EKORN_STAGE>, C<EKORN_SINK_ONE> or
C<EKORN_SINK_MANY>.
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Manual::Reference/Delivering parts for Ekorn> has
how.

=head2 How a run ends

A run ends in one of three ways, and each part's end is told which,
from where the part stands:

=over

=item * C<died>, if the run died, anywhere, before it ended;

=item * C<stopped>, if its input was cut short, by a stop at or after
it, or by the run being ended from outside, as an iterator's
L<finish|Ekorn::Pipeline::Iterator/finish> does;

=item * C<done>, if its input ran out, and the run didn't die. A part
whose input had run out before a stop is told C<done>, and so is a
sink that stops the run itself.

=back

So a stop ends the stream early for what's before it, and normally
for what's after it. In

    my $n = Ekorn::Pipeline->new(take(5), count_items)->iterator($lines)->();

C<$lines> is told C<stopped>, and closes its file, and C<count_items>,
after C<take(5)>, is told C<done>, and gives 5.

=head2 Flushes and ends

A flush is called once its part's input runs out normally: when the
values ran out, after a stop in a stage before it, or, for a sink, when
the sink stopped the run itself. What it returns goes on through the
stages after it, and while it runs, and they do, L</ending> is true. It
isn't told how the run ended, as the run hasn't.

An end:

=over

=item * always runs, once, when the run has ended, however it ended,
and is given how, as its argument: C<done>, C<stopped> or C<died>. A
run has ended as soon as nothing in it can still act on a value. With
a sink last, that's as the sink's result is ready, so a sink that
commits only when told C<done> commits then, and never for a run that
dies after it;

=item * gives nothing: what it returns is dropped;

=item * runs in order: the source's end first, then each stage's,
first stage first, so a source that fails to close is known before any
sink commits.

=back

After a stage dies, every end still runs, told C<died>, and then the
error is thrown again, as it would have been. An end that dies then is
reported as a warning, naming its stage, and the first error is kept.
An end that dies in a run that hadn't died ends the run with its
error, and the ends after it are told C<died>.

An iterator dropped before its values run out ends its run when the
last reference to it goes, as L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Iterator> describes.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 is_stage

    use Ekorn::Pipeline v0.1.3 qw(is_stage);

    is_stage($thing)

True if C<$thing> can be used as a stage: a code reference; a pipeline
of this class or a subclass; or an object offering one of the role
methods C<EKORN_STAGE>, C<EKORN_SINK_ONE> and C<EKORN_SINK_MANY>, such
as a stage made with L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather>, or a sink. It's the
same test L</new> uses. It's false for a string, even the name of a
pipeline, and for a source.

Use it in a function that takes its stages from the end of its
arguments, so that it accepts the same stages C<new> does, pipelines
included:

    sub fetch ($url, @args) {
        my @stages;
        unshift @stages, pop @args while @args && is_stage($args[-1]);
        ...
    }

It's exported on request. It's new in v0.1.3, so ask for that version
on the C<use> line, as above: v0.1.2 has no C<import>, so without the
version, C<use Ekorn::Pipeline qw(is_stage)> compiles under it, and
fails only when C<is_stage> is called.

A pipeline is a blessed hash, so C<is_hashref> is true of one too. A
function that takes a hash reference of options before its stages
should test C<is_stage> first, or it takes a pipeline for the options.

=head2 is_sink

    use Ekorn::Pipeline qw(is_sink);

    is_sink($thing)

Returns C<one> if C<$thing> is a sink of one, giving one value, and
C<many> if it's a sink of many, giving a list; for a pipeline, the sink
it ends in, if any. Both are true. It's false for anything else. A sink
is anything offering C<EKORN_SINK_ONE> or C<EKORN_SINK_MANY>, as
L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Sink> describes. It's exported on request.

=head2 ending

    Ekorn::Pipeline::ending()

True while a flush runs, and while the values it gave go through the
stages after it, rather than values from the source. It's for code that
tells its stages more about each value, such as where it came from: a
value from a flush has no such origin. It isn't exported.

=head2 run_context

    Ekorn::Pipeline::run_context()

Returns the context the run's source gave, if any: its C<context>, or
the third part its C<EKORN_SOURCE> method returned as a list, such as
a statement's column names. It's for stages that need to know about
the values' source, called as they run. Each run has its own. A pushed run has none, and an iterator
used as a source passes on its own run's. It isn't exported.

    sub pluck ($name) {
        return sub ($row) {
            my $columns = Ekorn::Pipeline::run_context()->{columns};
            my($at) = grep { $columns->[$_] eq $name } 0 .. $#$columns;
            return $row->[$at];
        };
    }

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Expected stage #%d to be a code reference or a pipeline

A stage given to L</new> wasn't a code reference or a pipeline. It's
also raised for a pipeline whose overridden C<stages> method returned
something that isn't a code reference.

=item Expected stage #%d to be a code reference, a pipeline or the name of one

A stage given to L</pipeline_in>, and so to the word C<pipeline>, or to
L</named> after the name, was
none of them. For C<named>, stages are counted from the first after
the name.

=item No pipeline named %s

A name given to L</pipeline_in>, and so to the word C<pipeline>, or to
L</named>, isn't defined in that package. The name is given qualified,
so it says which package it was looked up in. It may be defined in
another package, which a qualified name reaches.

=item A pipeline named %s is already defined

L</named> was given a name already defined for another pipeline.

=item Expected a name, made of words joined by ::

L</named> was given something other than a name.

=item Expected only a name, naming a pipeline you have

L</named>, on a pipeline, was given stages after the name.

=item Expected stage #%d to be a stage, not a source

A source, something offering C<EKORN_SOURCE> and none of a stage's
role methods, was given as a stage. Give it to L</iterator> instead.

=item Expected stage #%d to offer one of EKORN_STAGE, EKORN_SINK_ONE and EKORN_SINK_MANY, not %s

A stage offered more than one of the role methods, so it couldn't say
which it is.

=item Expected a code reference

The source given to L</iterator> wasn't a code reference, or anything
offering C<EKORN_SOURCE>.

=item Expected the source to return a code reference, and optionally an end and a context

A source's C<EKORN_SOURCE> returned something else. It's reported as
the run starts.

=item Expected stage #%s to return a code reference, and optionally a flush and an end

A stage's C<EKORN_STAGE> returned something else. It's reported as the
run starts.

=item Expected sink #%s to return a code reference, a flush, and optionally an end

A sink's C<EKORN_SINK_ONE> or C<EKORN_SINK_MANY> returned something
else. It's reported as the run starts.

=item Expected no stop in a set-up, as the run has nothing yet to stop

A set-up, or a role method, threw a L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stop>. The ends
of the parts already made are called, told C<died>.

=item Pipeline end of %s failed at %s line %d:

An end died, in a run that hadn't died. The message it died with
follows, indented, and the end is named: C<the source>, or a stage by
its position, as C<stage #2>. An exception object is passed on
unchanged.

=item Expected no stop in an end, as the run has ended

An end threw a L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Stop>, which is an error like any
other there, reported as the message above.

=item The end of %s died while the run was already dying: %s

A warning: an end died in a run that had died. The run's own error is
thrown, once every end has run.

=item Expected stage #%s, made with gather, to return a code reference or a pipeline, and optionally a flush and an end

The block given to L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Gather/gather> for that stage
returned something else.

=item Pipeline stage #%s failed at %s line %d:

A stage, or its flush, died. The message it died with follows,
indented. An exception object is passed on unchanged.

In this message and the one above, a stage is named by its position:
C<#2> for the second stage, or C<#2.3> for the third stage of a
pipeline given as the second stage.

A stage within a named pipeline, or of the named pipeline run, is
named with it too: after its position, the innermost named pipeline it's
in, by its L</name>, and its position there, as
C<#1.2 (main::clean#2)> for the second stage of the pipeline named
C<clean>, given as the first stage. It's the name the pipeline has
when the stage dies.
